This is the first pre-release version of the `fullstackhero .NET WebAPI Boilerplate` package. Newer versions will be available on a weekly basis with newer updates and patches. [Read the getting-started guide for more.](https://fullstackhero.net/dotnet-webapi-boilerplate/general/getting-started/)

The Release Version is expected to be out by November 2021 as soon as .NET 6 LTS is launched by Microsoft. Preview versions of this project are available for Initial Developer Testing.

## Quick Start Guide

Open up your Command Prompt / Powershell and run the following command to install the solution template.

```powershell
dotnet new --install FullStackHero.WebAPI.Boilerplate
```
This would install the `fullstackhero .NET WebAPI Boilerplate` template globally on your machine. With that done, let's see how you can start generating complete .NET WebAPI Solutions seamlessly.

Simply navigate to a new directory (wherever you want to place your new solution), and open up Command Prompt at the opened directory.

Run the following command. Note that, in this demonstration, I am naming my new solution as `FSH.Starter`.

```powershell
dotnet new fsh-api -o FSH.Starter
```
